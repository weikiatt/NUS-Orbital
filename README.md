NUS ORBITAL 2024 - Milestone 1

Team Name: 
TFT

Proposed Level of Achievement: 
Project Gemini

Motivation: 
Being students ourselves in NUS, we often find it difficult to foster collaborative learning between peers due to the lack of platforms for student interaction within specific modules or courses. To address this, weâ€™re planning to create a website forum similar to reddit/piazza and NUSMods. This forum will be accessible to all students, providing convenience and inclusive space for students to engage with each other. 

Aim:
To create a forum where people can communicate with one another and share their notes, fostering a collaborative environment where everyone can learn. 

User Stories:
As a student who wants to search for group mates, I want to be able to make a post to let others know that I am searching for a group.
As a student who wants to know more about a module, I want to be able to talk to other users who have taken the module before.
As a student who made a wrong post, I want to delete/edit the post.
As a prospective student who wants to take a module, I want to read about what past students feel about the module.
As a student, I want to access notes created by past students that have taken the module. 
As a student, I want to edit my account details.

Scope of Project:
TFT is a website that enables students to be able to connect with each other, share notes and ask questions.

How are we different from similar platforms?
There are currently no platforms that require the user to be an approved NUS student and sometimes, it can be locked behind a paywall (Studocu, Coursehero). 
There is no active forum that is available for all NUS students to use.
